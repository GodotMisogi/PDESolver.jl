"parallel_type": what method of parallelization to use, (Int), 1 = face, 2 = 
                 element, default implied by run_type: rk4 -> 1, any method
                 that requires calculating the Jacobian -> 2

"fname": the path to the file in which the dictionary is declared, ASCIIString,
         set from the argument passed to read_input

"gamma_1" : gamma - 1

"coloring_distance": how many elements between elements of the same color,
                     "Integer", value determined from stabilization chosen

"coloring_distance_prec": same as coloring_distance, for mesh used for
                          preconditioning.

"jac_method" : what method to use for computing the Jacobian (finite difference,
               or complex step, determined from "run_type", 1 finite difference
               2 = complex step

"solve" : call the solver specified by run_type, (Bool), default true

"use_src_term" : whether to call the source term routin, (Bool), false if 
                 the source term is the zero source term, otherwise true
"calc_dt": calculate the timestep based on the CFL, (Bool), false if delta_t
           is specified, otherwise true
"use_itermax": whether or not use itermax to halt rk4, (Bool), true if
               itermax is specified, otherwise false
