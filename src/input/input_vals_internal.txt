"need_adjoint": whether or not the adjoint will be used.  Currently Euler only

"parallel_type": how often to exchange parallel data, (Int) 1 = every residual
                 evaluation, 2 = every jacobian evaluation
                 default implied by run_type: rk4 -> 1, any method
                 that requires calculating the Jacobian -> 2


"parallel_data": what data to exchange in parallel, (ASCIIString), 
                 known values "face" for face data and "element" for element 
                 data, default implied by a set of other options which
                 determine the calculations that need to be done

"fname": the path to the file in which the dictionary is declared, ASCIIString,
         set from the argument passed to read_input

"gamma_1" : gamma - 1

"coloring_distance": how many elements between elements of the same color,
                     "Integer", value determined from stabilization chosen

"coloring_distance_prec": same as coloring_distance, for mesh used for
                          preconditioning.

"solve" : call the solver specified by run_type, (Bool), default true

"use_src_term" : whether to call the source term routin, (Bool), false if 
                 the source term is the zero source term, otherwise true
"calc_dt": calculate the timestep based on the CFL, (Bool), false if delta_t
           is specified, otherwise true
"use_itermax": whether or not use itermax to halt rk4, (Bool), true if
               itermax is specified, otherwise false
"Tsol" : datatype of solution variables, (DataType), set during initialization
"Tres" : datatype of residual variables, (DataType), set during initialization
"Tsbp" : datatype of SBP operator, (DataType), set during initialization, 
         nearly always to Float64
"Tmsh" : datatype of mesh variables, (DataType), set during initialization,
         until differentiation wrt the mesh variables is supported, this should
         always be Float64

"precompute_q_face": whether or not to use eqn.q_face, (Bool), determined from
                     "precompute_face_flux" and other things

"precompute_q_bndry": whether or not to use eqn.q_bndyr, (Bool), determined from
                      "precompute_bndry_flux" and other things
