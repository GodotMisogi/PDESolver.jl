# The following keys are used for the options dictionary in input_vals.jl

"run_type"  : what type of run, 1 = rk4, 4 = Newton finite difference, 5 = Newton complex step (integer)

"order" : order of accuracy of elements, 1-4 will be supported eventually (integer)


"delta_t" = timestep for rk4 (floating point)
"t_max" = maximum time for rk4 (floating point)

"smb_name" : name of smb file if using Pumi (string)
"dmg_name" : name of dmg file if using Pumi (string)

"IC_name" : initial condition function name (string)

"res_tol" : stopping tolerance for residual, used by rk4 and Newton methods
"step_tol" : step size tolerance for Newton methods (floating point)
"itermax" : maximum number of iterations for Newton methods (integer)

# boundary condition specification
"numBC" : number of boundary condtions used

# for each boundary condition there must be:
"BCi" : model edges (for 2d) where the boundary condition is applied
"BCi_name" : name of boundary condition to apply

# where i is the index of the boundary condition
# i must have values 1 through numBC

# paramters used by boundary and initial condiitions
"Ma" : free stream Mach number (floating point)
"Re" : Reynolds number (using the chord length as the distance) (floatingpoint)
"aoa" : angle of attack in degrees (floating point)
"rho_free" : free stream density
"E_free" : free stream energy
