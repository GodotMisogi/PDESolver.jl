# Launching a simulation
To solver the Euler equations, do

julia /path/to/startup.jl "input_file_name.jl"

where input_file_name.jl is in your current directory.

# The following keys are used for the options dictionary in the input file

"run_type"  : what type of run, 1 = rk4, 4 = Newton finite difference, 5 = Newton complex step (integer)

"order" : order of accuracy of elements, 1-4 will be supported eventually (integer)


"delta_t" = timestep for rk4 (floating point)
"t_max" = maximum time for rk4 (floating point)

"smb_name" : name of smb file if using Pumi (string), if it appears to be a relative path (ie. does not begin with a "/"), it is relative to the installation directory of PDESolver.  If it appears to be an absolute path, it is treated as such
"dmg_name" : name of dmg file if using Pumi (string), same behavior as "smb_name", default ".null" (you must omit this key if you are using the null geometric model)

"IC_name" : initial condition function name (string)

"res_tol" : stopping tolerance for residual, used by rk4 and Newton methods
"step_tol" : step size tolerance for Newton methods (floating point)
"itermax" : maximum number of iterations for Newton methods (integer)

# boundary condition specification
"numBC" : number of boundary condtions used

# for each boundary condition there must be:
"BCi" : model edges (for 2d) where the boundary condition is applied
"BCi_name" : name of boundary condition to apply

# where i is the index of the boundary condition
# i must have values 1 through numBC

# paramters used by boundary and initial condiitions
"Ma" : free stream Mach number (floating point)
"Re" : Reynolds number (using the chord length as the distance) (floatingpoint)
"aoa" : angle of attack in degrees (floating point)
"rho_free" : free stream density
"E_free" : free stream energy

"writeflux"  : writes the equation flux to the file Fxi.dat, space delimted, default false
"writeq"  : writes solution variables to the file q.dat, space delimited, (Bool) default false
"write_edge_vertnums"  : writes the vertex numbers of every edge to edge_vertnusm.dat (Bool), default false
"write_face_vertnums" : writes vertex number of every face to face_vertnums.dat, (Bool), default false
"write_boundarynums"  : writes the elements  number, global face number of each face with a boundary condition, one per line, (Bool), default false
"write_dxidx"  : writes dxidx for every node to file dxidx.dat, (Bool) default falsea
"write_coords" : writes coordinates of every node to file coords.dat, (Bool), default false

# Newton's Method debugging options
"write_rhs"  : write rhs (residual) to a file (rhs$i.dat) each iteration, (Bool), default false

"print_cond" : calculate and print Jacobian condition number each iteration, (Bool), default false
"write_sol"  : write the solution to a file (SL$i.dat) each iteration, (Bool), default false
"write_vis"  : write Paraview files (solution_newton$i.pvtu) each iteration, (Bool), default false
"print

# testing options
"solve" : call the solver specified by run_type, (Bool), default true
