# Newton's method

```@meta
CurrentModule = NonlinearSolvers
```

Newton's method is intended to compute updates to some q by solving the following equation.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial R(q)}{\partial q} \Delta q = -R(q)
\end{equation}

In the most basic implementation of Newton's method in PDESolver, q corresponds to the solution, 
  and f(q) corresponds to the residual evaluation of the currently selected physics module.

An example of a more sophisticated use of Newton's method is within the Crank-Nicolson timestepper, 
  which adds another layer on top of the physics residual:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial g(R(q))}{\partial q} \Delta q = -g(R(q))
\end{equation}

## Features

PDESolver's Newton's method has a wide variety of features. 
It contains the Jacobian calculation routines, which can be performed currently using:

* finite-differencing 
* complex-step

The Jacobian functions can act upon any arbitrary residual.

Additionally, the following matrix forms are supported:

* Julia dense
* Julia sparse
* PETSc sparse
* Matrix-free

The function that performs the Newton iteration is

## Jacobian calculation

Special mention of calcJacobianComplex.

One of the most involved parts of Newton's method is forming the Jacobian.
The NonlinearSolvers module contains the function [`physicsJac`](@ref) to
compute the Jacobian of the physics $\frac{\partial R(q)}{\partial q}$, where
$R$ is [`evalResidual`](@ref).  This function can be used by other methods
as a starting point for computing the residual of $g(R(q))$ described at the
top of this page.

`physicsJac` calls one of several functions to compute the Jacobian.  Users
should not call these functions directly, they should use `physicsJac`.
