# PDESolver User Interface Interface

## Invoking the Code
This page describes the API for running the code, as well as utility scripts
that provide simple operation of the code.

The entry point for running the code is the function [`run_solver`](@ref)

```@docs
run_solver
```

Each physics module is required to register itself with `using PhysicsModule`
is run.
When using this API to invoke the code, using should be sure to using the
required physics module before calling `run_solver`.

In order to facilitate running the code, the script `src/startup.jl` loads
all the physics modules and passes the first command line argument as the
input file name
