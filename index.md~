# PDESolver Documentation
Welcome to the PDESolver documentation.  These documents provide an overview
of PDESolver, a Julia based solver for partial differential equations.
This page will describe the form of the equations and the Summation-By-Parts
operators used to discretize them.  The [Table of Contents](@ref) links to
the components of PDESolver that calculate each term.

## Form of the Equation

PDESolver discretizes equation in the form:

$\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = \mathcal{R}(u, t)$
