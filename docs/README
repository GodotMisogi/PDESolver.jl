README for generating docs + using Documenter & mkdocs

### New Method ###
We now use Documenter to generate html directly

1. Make doc changes
2. Run `julia ./make.jl`
3. Use web browser to view changes, ex. firefox ./build/index.html
4. run deploy_docs.sh to deploy docs to github

### Old Method ###
=== How to run mkdocs locally ===
1. Make your doc changes
2. run `mkdocs serve --dev-addr=IP:PORT`
    Example: `mkdocs serve --dev-addr=128.113.130.100:8005`
3. Open IP:PORT in any browser on the correct network


# Documentation Standards

Docstrings for functions should answer the following questions

1) What is the purpose of the function? (1-2 sentances)
2) What method/algorithm does it use? (~1 paragraph)
3) What are the arguments and returned values to the function and what do they
   mean? (1 sentance each)
4) What is the state of all arguments on entry? (1-2 sentances each)
5) What is the state of all argument on exit? (1-2 sentances each

For simple functions, 2) may not be very short and 3-5 may be combined.
The major distinction between 3) and 4) - 5) is when arguments are 
Types whose fileds will be accessed.  If fileds are access, the documentation
should describe which ones are used.

Item 3 should be formatted as follows (the Markdown makes the website much
more readable)

  **Inputs**:

    * arg1: description here
    * arg2: description here

  **Inputs/Outputs**:

    * input/output1: description here
    * input/output2: description here

  **Output**:

    * output1: description here
    * output2: description here

`Inputs` are arguments that are passed into the function and not modified.
`Inputs/Outputs`: are arguments that are passed into the function and modified
                  (arrays are are common example)
`Outputs`: values that are returned by the function
