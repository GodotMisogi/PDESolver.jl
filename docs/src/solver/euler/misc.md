# Miscellaneous Function

```@meta
  CurrentModule = EulerEquationMod
```

This page documents a bunch of functions that are useful but don't fit into
another catagory.

Actually, some of these functions do fit into another catagory and new files
should be created to move them into.


A bunch of the things in euler_funcs.jl

```@autodocs
  Modules = [EulerEquationMod]
  Pages = ["euler/euler_funcs.jl", "euler/entropy_flux.jl"]
```
